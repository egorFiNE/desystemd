# desystemd

Remove `systemd` footprint from Ubuntu servers along with a list of useless packages (like `open-iscsi`) and bloatware (like `snap`).

Only supported OS for now is Ubuntu 25.04 Server and Server only. The approach used here isn't remotely suitable or even needed for a GUI Linux, because `systemd` and it's elements are a hard requirement on a desktop.

## How to run

Open it in the editor, read it and copy-paste parts into the terminal, so you have a clear understanding of what this script does to the OS. It will not run until you read the script.

## Ideas?

Please please open an issue in this repo.
