# desystemd

Remove systemd footprint from Ubuntu servers along with a list of useless packages (like `open-iscsi`) and bloatware (like snap).

Only supported OS for now is Ubuntu 25.04 server. This will absolutely destroy a desktop installation.

This script is pretty much WIP.

## How to run

Open it in the browser, read it and copy-paste parts into the terminal, so you have a clear understanding of what this script does to the OS.

Otherwise if YOLO:

```bash
sudo ./desystemd.sh
```

## Ideas?

Please please open an issue in this repo.
