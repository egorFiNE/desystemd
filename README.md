# desystemd

Remove systemd footprint from Ubuntu servers along with a list of useless packages (like `open-iscsi`) and bloatware (like snap).

Only supported OS for now is Ubuntu 24.04 server. This will absolutely destroy your desktop.

This script is pretty much WIP.

## How to run

```bash
sudo ./desystemd.sh
```

The script will ask a few questions and run. The script is more or less idempotent.

## Ideas?

Please please share in issues in this repo.
